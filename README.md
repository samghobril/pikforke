> bash script to list the Pitchfork review scores for a certain musician/band.

I've always had the habit of looking up Pitchfork review scores for musicians I'm thinking of checking out. This makes it easier/faster for me to do.

## How to use
*HTML-XML-utils is required for usage. You can download it here: [https://www.w3.org/Tools/HTML-XML-utils/](HTML-XML-utils)*
1. Copy the [pikforke.sh](pikforke.sh) file and paste it into /usr/local/bin (or wherever your $PATH variable points to).
2. Run pikforke.sh from the Terminal. You can also give the command the musician/band name as an argument, without waiting for the prompt, as such:
> pikforke.sh "Kanye West"

## Contribute
I'm completely new to bash scripting, so I'd be happy to accept improvements and additional features.
